<para>
Fix a noetherian scheme $S$ and write $\Sch(S)$ for the essentially small category of finite type $S$-schemes.
Let $\Sm(S)$ denote the full subcategory of smooth and finite type $S$-schemes.
</para>

<def tag="projective model structure">
Consider the cocomplete category $\SPSh(\Sm(S)) = \PSh(\Sm(S)), \SSet)$ of simplicial presheaves on $\Sm(S)$ (<cite tag="simplicial presheaves/simplicial presheaf" />).
Recall that the projective model structure on this category has objectwise weak equivalences and objectwise fibrations, where we consider $\SSet$ with the standard model structure (<cite tag="simplicial sets/model structure" />); see (<cite tag="simplicial presheaves/projective model structure" />).
Note that the fibrant objects are simplicial presheaves that take values in Kan complexes.
This model category presents the $(\infty,1)$-category of $(\infty,1)$-presheaves on $\infSm(S)$.
</def>

<def tag="Nisnevich-local projective model structure">
Consider the Nisnevich topology on the category $\Sm(S)$ (???).
Recall that one has a <d>Nisnevich-local projective model structure</d> on $\SPSh(\Sm(S))$, where fibrant objects are presheaves that take values in Kan complexes  and satisfy descent with respect to Nisnevich hypercovers (<cite tag="simplicial presheaves/local projective model structure" />).
This model category presents the hypercompletion of the $(\infty,1)$-category of $(\infty,1)$-sheaves on $\infSm(S)$.
The homotopy category with respect to this model structure, which we will denote by $\Spc(S)$, is called the category of <d>motivic spaces</d> over $S$.

Note that there is a canonical functor
  \[ \L_S : \Sm(S) \to \Spc(S) \]
which maps a scheme $X$ in $\Sm(S)$ to the motivic space $\L_S(X)$ which maps $Y \in \Sm(S)$ to the constant simplicial set $\Hom_{\Sm(S)}(Y, X)$.
Indeed note that this presheaf is clearly fibrant with respect to the Nisnevich-local projective model structure.
</def>

<def tag="A^1-local projective model structure;unstable motivic homotopy category">
The <d>$\A^1$-local projective model structure</d> on $\SPSh(\Sm(S))$ is the left Bousfield localization of the Nisnevich-local projective model structure at the class of morphisms
  \[ \L_S(X \times_S  \A^1_S) \too \L_S(X) \]
induced by the projections $X \times_S \A^1_S \to X$, for $X$ in $\Sm(S)$.
The homotopy category with respect to this model structure, which we will denote by $\H(S)$, is called the <d>unstable motivic homotopy category</d> over $S$.
</def>

<def tag="Tate sphere">
Let $T$ be a cofibrant replacement of the <d>Tate sphere</d>, the motivic space associated to the homotopy cofibre of the morphism 
  \[ \L_S(\Gmult_S) \too \L_S(\A^1_S) \]
induced by the inclusion $\Gmult_S \hook \A^1_S$, where $\Gmult_S$ denotes the complement of the point $0$ in the affine line $\A^1_S$.
</def>

<def tag="stable motivic homotopy category">
Consider the category $\Spt_T^\Sigma(\SPSh(\Sm(S)))$ of symmetric $T$-spectra in $\SPSh(\Sm(S))$ (<cite tag="spectra/symmetric spectra" />).
Recall that it has a stable projective model structure induced by the $\A^1$-local projective model structure on $\SPSh(\Sm(S))$ (<cite ref="ayoub">Ayoub, 4.3.29</cite>).
The homotopy category associated to this model structure is called the <d>stable motivic homotopy category</d> over $S$, denoted $\SH(S)$.
We write
  \[ \M_S : \Sm(S) \too \SH(S) \]
for the composite of the functor $\L_S : \Sm(S) \to \H(S)$ with the localization functor $\H(S) \to \SH(S)$.
