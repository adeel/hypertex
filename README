TeXML is an XML-based markup language that I use for writing mathematical notes and articles.

The script texml.py converts .txml files to HTML or LaTeX files, using MathJax to render math in the first case.
It is currently in a very primitive state.
The files template.html and template.tex can be modified as desired, to change the layouts and styling.
See the tests/ folder for (out-of-date) examples.
