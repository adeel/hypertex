HyperTeX is, roughly speaking, a hyperlink-enhanced version of LaTeX.
More precisely, HyperTeX is an XML-based markup language designed for
writing collections of inter-linked mathematical documents.

This repository contains a Python package, called hypertex, which is
able to parse HyperTeX documents and render them in HTML or LaTeX
format.  The HTML rendering makes use of MathJax to display mathematical
formulas.

The HyperTeX syntax has not been finalized yet and a complete
description is at the moment unavailable.  The main interesting feature
is the <cite> tag, which allows linking to other HyperTeX documents
(and even to specific paragraphs within them), or to external
references.  For example,

    ..., so the claim follows from the <cite tag="intersection-
    theory/GRR">Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem</cite>.
