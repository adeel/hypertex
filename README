TeXML is an XML-based markup language that I use for writing mathematical notes and articles.

The script texml.py converts .txml files to HTML files, using MathJax to render math.
It is currently in a very primitive state.
The file template.html can be modified as desired.
Conversion from TeXML to LaTeX will probably be added soon (this requires only modifying the template.html file).
See the tests/ folder for examples.
